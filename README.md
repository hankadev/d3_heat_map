# Visualize Data with a Heat Map

This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Heat Map project.

## Objective

Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JEXgeY/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style. You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.

Dataset provided by freeCodeCamp can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json).

User stories:

- **User Story #1:** My heat map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.
- **User Story #2:** My heat map should have a description with a corresponding `id="description"`.
- **User Story #3:** My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding `id="x-axis`".
- **User Story #4:** My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding `id="y-axis`".
- **User Story #5:** My heat map should have `rect` elements with a `class="cell"` that represent the data.
- **User Story #6:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.
- **User Story #7:** Each cell will have the properties `data-month`, `data-year`, `data-temp` containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
- **User Story #8:** The `data-month`, `data-year` of each cell should be within the range of the data.
- **User Story #9:** My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
- **User Story #10:** My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
- **User Story #11:** My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
- **User Story #12:** My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
- **User Story #13:** My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding `id="legend"`.
- **User Story #14:** My legend should contain `rect` elements.
- **User Story #15:** The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
- **User Story #16:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
- **User Story #17:** My tooltip should have a `data-year` property that corresponds to the `data-year` of the active area.
